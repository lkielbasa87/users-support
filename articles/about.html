				<h1>What is this service for?</h1>
				<div class="content">
					<p>The service you are using was made to report common IT problems by company's users.</p>

					<p>If your computer stopped working, your smartphone lost mail configuration, you totally, accidentally forgot some very common IT procedures in your company then this service is for you.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>You don't remember how to log in and clean your overflow comapny mailbox?</li>
						<li>You don't remember how to remotely connect with admin so he can help you?</li>
						<li>You don't remember how to establish VPN connection so you can safely use your company's resources?</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Some of above are common and repeating IT requests. Before you call your IT admin you can try to check if there may be short article written how to deal with your issue? If you didn't use something for a very long time it is fair to forget how to use it. In case of that kind of situations you can add articles containing solutions for user's problems.</p>

					<p>What's more - if you have <strong>any suggestion</strong> of interesting article - go on and send it to me by the form on main page and I will post it for others.</p>
